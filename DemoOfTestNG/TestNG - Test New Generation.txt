TestNG - Test New Generation

Java Based Unit testing Tool

 Merits
=======
1. Test cases and test suites
2. Grouping of test cases
3. Prioritize
4. Parameterization
6. Parallel testing
7. Reports

TestNG Configuration
---------------------
1. Install TestNG in Eclipse
2. Add TestNG library to build path/add TestNG dependency in pom.xml

@Test

1.TestNG execute test methods based on alphabetical orders
2.@Test(priority=num) controls the order of execution
3.Once you provide priority to the test methods then order of methods is not considered
4.Priority can be random numbers(no need to have consecutive numbers)
5.If you don't provide priority then default value is zero (0)
6.If the priorities are same then again execute methods in alphabetical orders
7.Negative values are allows in priority
8.TestNG execute test methods only if they are having @Test annotation

Test XML File
-------------
1. Generate Automatically
2.Manually
 
Test Suite-> test cases-> test steps
xml file->classes->test Methods

Things achieved through xml
1. Executed group of test cases as a one suite
2.We can generate testing reports(default)
