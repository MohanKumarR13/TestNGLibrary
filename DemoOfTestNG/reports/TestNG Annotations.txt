Hard vs Soft assertions
=======================
Soft assertion and hard assertion are two types of assertions in TestNG123. A hard assertion throws an exception immediately when an assert statement fails, and stops the test execution123. A soft assertion does not throw an exception immediately when an assert statement fails, and continues the test execution123. Soft assertions are useful when you want to verify multiple conditions in a test case.
